# Hi there 👋, I'm **Przemek**

I'm a software builder, data analyst and digital artist developing long-term projects at the intersection of **AI, narrative design, system automation and creative technology**.

With strong experience in **management, process optimization and leading complex operations**, I combine strategic thinking with technical execution — creating tools and frameworks that bring structure, clarity and measurable improvements.

I enjoy crafting systems that simplify work, accelerate decision-making and turn complexity into predictable, well-organized workflows.

## 🧠 About me  
With a background in **Computer Science** and the **Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity**, I work across software development, analytics and digital art.  
I have many years of experience in **managing teams, operations and multi-layer projects**, which directly shapes the way I design and build systems — structured, scalable and efficient.

I split my time between:
- 🛠 creating internal tools, automation workflows and data-driven systems  
- 🎨 developing the cyberpunk/surreal art universe **EXON 5**  
- 📈 researching AI-driven storytelling, algorithmic creativity and predictive models  
- 🧩 designing processes that improve productivity and decision-making

## 🔭 I’m currently working on  
- **EXON 5** — a cyberpunk narrative art project with expanding lore  
- **Data automation systems** for organizing and analyzing operational information  
- **A personal algorithm for creative idea generation** and visual concept exploration  
- **Algorithmic trading experiments** — testing, optimizing and evaluating strategies based on technical indicators, sentiment and pattern detection  
- **Long-term planning frameworks** that turn goals into daily, repeatable habits
